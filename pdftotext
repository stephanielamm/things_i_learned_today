-fixed number
Assume fixed-pitch (or tabular) text, with the specified character width (in points). This forces physical layout mode.
-raw
Keep the text in content stream order. This is a hack which often "undoes" column formatting, etc. Use of raw mode is no longer recommended.

-bbox
Generate an XHTML file containing bounding box information for each word in the file.
-enc encoding-name

Lits the available encodings
-eol unix | dos | mac
Sets the end-of-line convention to use for text output.

Specify the user password for the PDF file.
